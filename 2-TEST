INSTRUCTIONS FOR VERIFYING CORRECTNESS
======================================

There are scripts in the test/dtrsm/ and test/dpotrf/ directories that
verifies the correctness on numerous randomly chosen inputs.

The following instructions assumes that you have followed the
instructions in 1-COMPILE and therefore have a build/ directory at the
top level of the repository tree.



To test the dtrsm example, follow these steps:

1. Run

   cd build/examples/dtrsm/

2. Run

   ../../../test/dtrsm/dtrsm-correctness.py

3. Verify that there are no reported failures



To test the dpotrf example, follow these steps:

1. Run

   cd build/examples/dpotrf/

2. Run

   ../../../test/dpotrf/dpotrf-correctness.py

3. Verify that there are no reported failures



Please contact the NLAFET coordinator Bo Kågström (bokg@cs.umu.se) if
you encounter any failures.




INSTRUCTIONS FOR TESTING PERFORMANCE
====================================

There are scripts in the test/dtrsm/ and test/dpotrf/ directories that
carry out extensive performance tests.

The following instructions assumes that you have followed the
instructions in 1-COMPILE and therefore have a build/ directory at the
top level of the repository tree.



To test the performance of the dtrsm example, follow these steps:

1. Run

   cd build/examples/dtrsm/

2. Run

   cp ../../../data/dtrsm/config-performance.json config.json

3. Follow the instructions in the
   "../../../test/dtrsm/dtrsm-performance.py" script to adapt the
   configuration file "config.json" to your machine.

4. Run

   ../../../test/dtrsm/dtrsm-performance.py config.json



To test the performance of the dpotrf example, follow these steps:

1. Run

   cd build/examples/dpotrf/

2. Run

   cp ../../../data/dpotrf/config-performance.json config.json

3. Follow the instructions in the
   "../../../test/dpotrf/dpotrf-performance.py" script to adapt the
   configuration file "config.json" to your machine.

4. Run

   ../../../test/dpotrf/dpotrf-performance.py config.json



We encourage you to share specifications of your machine and the
output files with the NLAFET coordinator Bo Kågström (bokg@cs.umu.se).
