INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANALYZING THE OUTPUT OF PERFORMANCE TESTS
==========================================================

The test/dtrsm/ and test/dpotrf/ directories contain scripts that can
analyze the data generated by the performance testing scripts.



To analyze the data for the dtrsm example, follow these steps:

1. Run

   test/dtrsm/dtrsm-analyze-performance.py < path-to-data

   where you should replace "path-to-data" with the actual path to a
   data file generated by "dtrsm-performance.py".

2. Refer to the documentation in
   "test/dtrsm/dtrsm-analyze-performance.py" for how to interpret the
   output.



To analyze the data for the dpotrf example, follow these steps:

1. Run

   test/dpotrf/dpotrf-analyze-performance.py < path-to-data

   where you should replace "path-to-data" with the actual path to a
   data file generated by "dpotrf-performance.py".

2. Refer to the documentation in
   "test/dpotrf/dpotrf-analyze-performance.py" for how to interpret
   the output.



We encourage you to share specifications of your machine and the
output of the analysis with the NLAFET coordinator Bo Kågström
(bokg@cs.umu.se).
