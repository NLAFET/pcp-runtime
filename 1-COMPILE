INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILING AND LINKING THE RUNTIME SYSTEM AND EXAMPLES

CMake (https://cmake.org/) is used for the build process. Follow these
basic instructions to build the library and examples.

1. Create a directory called "build".
2. Change to the "build" directory.
3. Run "ccmake ../src".
4. Type "c" for configure.
5. Configure as appropriate.
6. Type "c" again to reconfigure.
7. Type "g" to generate and exit.
8. Run "make" to build. 

Assuming that there were no errors, you will now have two executables:
+ build/examples/dtrsm/test-dtrsm.x
+ build/examples/dpotrf/test-dpotrf.x

The runtime library is located at build/runtime/libpcp.a.
