INSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPILING AND LINKING THE RUNTIME SYSTEM AND EXAMPLES
======================================================================

CMake (https://cmake.org/) is used for the build process. You will
need to first install libhwloc, BLAS (with the cblas interface), and
LAPACK.



Follow these instructions to build the library and examples.

1. Create a directory called "build"

2. Change to the "build" directory

3. Run

   ccmake ../src

4. Type "c" for configure

5. Configure as appropriate

6. Type "c" again to reconfigure

7. Type "g" to generate and exit

8. Run

   make
   
   to build



Assuming that there were no errors, you will now have two executables:
+ build/examples/dtrsm/test-dtrsm.x
+ build/examples/dpotrf/test-dpotrf.x

The runtime library is located at build/runtime/libpcp.a.
